# The certification pipeline's self-test.
#
# The Rust half of this pipeline (gate/signing.rs, gate/card.rs) has tests that
# run on every PR. The shell and Python half -- which decides who may stamp, who
# may seal, whether a runner can reach untrusted code, and whether a record was
# signed -- had none. Every one of those guards was verified once, by hand, and
# then trusted forever.
#
# EVERY check here has a NEGATIVE CONTROL: the guard is shown failing on input
# it must reject, not merely passing on input it should accept. A guard that has
# only ever been seen to pass is indistinguishable from a guard that cannot
# fail, and the second kind is worse than no guard at all because it reports
# safety.

# Runs offline. No network, no GitHub API, no GPU.
